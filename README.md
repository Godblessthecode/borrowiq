# BorrowIQ: Loan Default Predictor

**Author**: Alain Sorurian  
**Project Type**: Consumer Credit Risk Modeling  
**Dataset**: LendingClub Loan Data (2016–2020)

## 🚀 Project Overview
CredIQ is a machine learning project that predicts loan default probability using consumer loan data. It combines financial domain expertise with data science techniques and delivers insights through an interactive Streamlit dashboard.

## 🔍 Objectives
- Predict loan default using borrower features
- Demonstrate data preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation
- Build an interactive dashboard for loan scoring
- Showcase skills in Python, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, and Streamlit

## 📦 Features
- Data cleaning and preprocessing pipeline
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Logistic Regression and XGBoost models
- Evaluation using ROC-AUC, confusion matrix, etc.
- Feature importance and explainability (SHAP)
- Streamlit app for real-time loan scoring

## 🧰 Tech Stack
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, SHAP)
- Streamlit
- Git & GitHub
- LendingClub Dataset from Kaggle
